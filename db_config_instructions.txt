To fix the database connection error, follow these steps:

1. Create or update the .env file in the root directory with the following settings:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=inventory
DB_PORT=8889

JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

2. If you already have a .env file, make sure these values match what you provided.

3. MAMP uses port 8889 by default for MySQL, so make sure the server is configured to use this port.

4. If you need to change the database name from 'inventory' to 'ui_resale' (as seen in your SQL dump), update the DB_NAME accordingly.

5. After updating the .env file, restart your server application.
