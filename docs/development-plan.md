# Resale MVP - Development Plan
Development principles:
Modular Design: Clear separation of concerns between UI, services, and data
Type Safety: TypeScript is used throughout for better code quality
API Abstraction: Service layers abstract external API communication
Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS for adaptive layouts
Scalable Structure: Ready for expansion to additional marketplaces

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for building the Resale MVP - an analytics platform for e-commerce sellers, starting with eBay integration. The application will be built as a monorepo using Next.js, Node.js, and MySQL, following a black and yellow enterprise-level design theme.
