This roadmap outlines the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for **Resale**—an application that consolidates e-commerce analytics (initially for eBay) and provides insights into profitability and competitor data. The following sections detail the core features needed for the MVP, how they integrate, and considerations for future expansion.

---

## 1. Core Objectives

1. **Enable eBay Account Connection**: Allow users to authenticate and retrieve their eBay sales data in real time or on-demand.
2. **Provide Basic (But Actionable) Analytics**:  
   - Total ROI, Total Profit, Profit Margins  
   - Top-Selling Products  
   - Sell-Through Rate (30-day period)  
3. **Competitor Analysis**: Leverage the eBay Search API to compare product price, shipping cost, listing position, number of images, and seller feedback scores.
4. **Simple User Management**:  
   - **Admin**: Generate signup keys, manage users.  
   - **User**: Access personal dashboards and connect eBay accounts.
5. **High-Converting Landing Page**: Present the value proposition clearly for prospective users, with an enterprise-level feel.

## 2. Feature Breakdown

Below is a breakdown of each MVP feature, including functionality and implementation notes.

### 2.1 Landing Page
- **Purpose**: Showcase app benefits and convert visitors into users.  
- **Core Content**:
  - Brief explanation of analytics features (true profit, competitor insights).  
  - Enterprise-level design, but friendly for small-to-mid-sized sellers.
  - Call-to-action (CTA) to sign up.  
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Keep it visually appealing with a strong Black-Yellow theme.
  - Single-page structure (no need for extensive A/B testing initially).
  - Use Next.js SSR for fast initial load.

### 2.2 Authentication (Login & Signup)
- **Login Page**:
  - **JWT-based** authentication.  
  - Email/Password form with “Remember Me” or minimal session-based approach.  
  - Simple design focusing on immediate entry into the app.
- **Signup Page**:
  - **Key-Based Registration**: Users must provide a valid key (generated by Admin) to create an account.  
  - Store user credentials and validate key usage.  
  - Extend code structure for future subscription tiers.

### 2.3 Dashboard Page
- **Key Metrics (for eBay)**:
  1. **Total ROI** (placeholder formula until official logic is defined).  
  2. **Total Profit** (placeholder formula).  
  3. **Profit Margins** (placeholder formula).  
  4. **Top-Selling Products**: Based on quantity sold or revenue over the last 30 days.  
- **Analytics Layout**:
  - Clean cards or chart elements.  
  - Keep design flexible for future integrations (Amazon, Etsy, etc.).

### 2.4 Products Page
- **List of Products**:
  - **Columns**: Product name, price, quantity sold, true profit, sell-through rate, click-through rate, time to sell.
  - Filter/search functionality (e.g., by SKU, date range).
- **Competitor Analysis (Basic)**:
  - **Price Comparison**: Compare user’s product price (including shipping) to competitor averages.  
  - **Listing Quality**: Compare number of images, listing position in search results.  
  - **Seller Feedback**: Basic read of competitor’s seller feedback scores.  
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Data via eBay API (sales history, competitor listings).
  - Store minimal competitor snapshot in DB or fetch on demand to remain within eBay’s usage terms (no strong rate-limit concerns yet).

### 2.5 Settings Page
- **Connect eBay Account**:
  - OAuth or eBay token flow to allow data retrieval.  
  - Manage token refresh if needed.
- **Reset Password**:
  - Email-based reset flow (or a simpler approach for MVP if you prefer manual resets).
- **(Future)**: UI structure for adding additional platforms.

## 3. Technical Considerations

1. **Tech Stack**  
   - **Frontend**: Next.js for SSR, responsive design, minimal overhead.  
   - **Backend**: Node.js (Express or built-in Next.js API routes), MySQL for data storage.  
   - **API Structure**: Simple REST endpoints to fetch and modify data.  
   - **Hosting**: VPS or flexible solution (can migrate to AWS, Vercel, etc. later).

2. **Database Design**  
   - **Users Table**: Basic fields (email, password hash, signup key, role).  
   - **eBay Accounts Table**: References user accounts, stores OAuth tokens.  
   - **Products Table**: For storing local product data, mapped from eBay.  
   - **Competitor Data Table** (Optional for caching): Product ID reference, competitor metrics.  
   - **Keys Table**: Track which keys were used, by whom, and expiration status.

3. **Scalability & Future Integrations**  
   - **Modular Approach**: Keep eBay integration logic isolated, so we can add Amazon, Etsy, etc. with minimal refactoring.  
   - **Placeholder Formulas**: True profit, ROI can expand once we define shipping costs, eBay fees, taxes, etc.

4. **Security**  
   - **JWT Auth**: Secure endpoints and ensure user data is protected.  
   - **Input Validation**: Sanitize external data (especially from eBay APIs).  
   - **Admin Functions**: Restrict key generation, data management to admin role only.

## 4. Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Foundations
1. **Infrastructure Setup**  
   - Create repository (GitHub) & version control standards.  
   - Set up Next.js, Node.js, MySQL.
2. **Admin Key Generation**  
   - Page for Admin Accounts to Generate and Manage Signup Keys, I want to see which account uses what key
3. **Authentication**  
   - Implement JWT-based login/signup with key validation.
4. **Landing Page**  
   - Create basic, high-converting design.

### Phase 2: eBay Integration & Dashboard
1. **Connect eBay Account**  
   - Implement OAuth or token approach for pulling data.
2. **Fetch Sales Data**  
   - Query eBay API for listings/sales data.  
   - Store relevant info in MySQL.
3. **Dashboard**  
   - Display aggregated metrics (placeholder formulas for profit, margin, etc.).  
   - Show top-selling products.

### Phase 3: Products & Competitor Analysis
1. **Products Page**  
   - List all products with key metrics (sell-through, click-through, time to sell).  
   - Implement search/filter features.
2. **Competitor Analysis**  
   - Use eBay search API to compare price/shipping, listing position, images, and seller feedback.  
   - Display comparison metrics in the product details or side-by-side.

### Phase 4: Settings & Final Touches
1. **Settings Page**  
   - eBay account management, reset password.  
   - Basic user profile info (optional for MVP).
2. **Testing & Refinements**  
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and user feedback cycles.  
   - Polish UI elements, fix bugs, and optimize load times.
3. **Deployment**  
   - Configure VPS or chosen hosting environment.  
   - Enable basic CI workflow from GitHub for testing to production push.

## 5. Post-MVP Considerations

- **Expanded Integrations**: Amazon, Etsy, and other marketplaces.  
- **Advanced Analytics**: More nuanced profit calculations (fees, shipping, taxes), advanced competitor metrics (shipping times, seller feedback, store category).  
- **Subscription Tiers**: Different roles and feature sets (e.g., free tier vs. pro tier).  
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching competitor data, implementing load balancing if user base grows.  
- **Marketing & Growth**: More robust landing page, A/B testing, funnel analytics.

## 6. Conclusion

This **MVP** focuses on delivering **core analytics** to eBay sellers through a **simple, high-performing** Next.js app. By structuring the application in **modular phases**, we ensure future flexibility to add new platforms, advanced data points, and subscription tiers. The **key-based signup**, **JWT authentication**, and **initial competitor analysis** will demonstrate the unique value Resale provides—laying the groundwork for broader e-commerce integrations and more robust feature sets in later iterations.
